# Drury-DABSC - Dual ABS Signal Controller
## License: Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike


The Dual ABS Signal Controller provides a simple, no software,
solution for the modeler looking for a prototypical Automatic Block
Signaling (ABS) system.  This board provides signal control for two
blocks of 3 aspect (Green - Yellow - Red) route signaling for two
blocks.  The Dual ABS Signal Controller can be used in either single
track (1 segment for each signaled direction) or double track (Rule
251, Current of Traffic) applications.

This is an excellent product for modular and sectional railroads
as well as permanent applications.  We recommend our cpOD (screw
terminal option) detector for detection input.

Note: The Dual ABS Signal Controller is NOT MSS compatible.

This board is designed and supported by Dennis Drury, a former
Southern Pacific Signal Maintainer and the design has given him
good service for 30 years! See Dennis' clinic from the 2017 PCR
Convention on the development of this board.

The DABSC draws about 30mA at 5V.
